Chapter 3

Virtual memory

1) The Georgian alphabet has 33 letters.  How many bit are needed to specify a letter.

You would need 6 bits, since 5 bits only covers 32 letters.

2) In the UTF-16 character encoding, the binary representation of a character can take up to 32 bits.  Ignoring the details of the encoding scheme, how many different characters can be represented?

32 ^ 2 = 1024

3) What is the difference between "memory" and "storage" as defined in Think OS?

Memory is held in the random access memory (RAM) while storage is defined as the hard disk or solid state drive.

4) What is the difference between a GiB and a GB?  What is the percentage difference in their sizes?

GiB is 2^30 bytes, whereas GB is 10^9 bytes. That's about a 7.37% difference.

5) How does the virtual memory system help isolate processes from each other?

A process cannot access data belonging to another process since there is no virtual address that can be generated that maps to physical memory allocated to another process.

6) Why do you think the stack and the heap are usually located at opposite ends of the address space?

The stack adds more addresses downward and the heap adds more addresses upward to efficiently add addresses.

7) What Python data structure would you use to represent a sparse array?

A python dictionary could represent a sparse array.

8) What is a context switch?

A context swtich is when the operating system interupts a running process, save its state and runs another process.

As an exercise, run aspace.c on your computer and compare your results to mine.
  
1) Add a second call to malloc and check whether the heap on your system grows up (toward larger addresses). 

Goes up.
Address of p is 0x7f9ae8404c80
Address of r is 0x7f9ae8404d00 

2) Add a function that prints the address of a local variable, and check whether the stack grows down.  

Goes down.
Address of local1 is 0x7fff574c26c8
Address of local2 is 0x7fff574c26c4

3) Choose a random number between 1 and 32, and allocate two chunks with that size.  How much space is there between them?  Hint: Google knows how to subtract hexadecimal numbers.

Chosen number: 9
0x40 -> 64 in decimal
